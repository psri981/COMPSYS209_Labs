# Welcome to Your EE209 Labs Repository

- This is a repository used by individual students to store solutions to the EE209 labs
- There is a folder per each lab and within this folder you will find
  - A lab documents explaining what needs to be done during the lab
  - LTspice or Proteus models needed for each lab 
  - A script to write your final answers to the lab questions (alternatively you may write the answers in a printed copy of the lab document)
- In case you like to get a fresh copy of these documents, a copy of these documents are available on Canvas under labs
- This entire system is managed by an open-source version control system called "git"
  - This is then hosted by the company "GitHub", which is one provider of the "git" service
  - By using "git" you can keep many versions of your work
  - Also it will be easier to get support remotely (if you wish to) as the teaching team has direct access to your documents
- Remember, you can ask a staff member or a TA at any time you need assistance
  - Through Slack, Zoom and GitHub we could provide support during after hours

# The Git Basics

During the 1st week of EE209 you would have already learnt how to use GitHub Desktop. In CS202 you would also learn how to use Git. If you like to setup GitHub Desktop and/or Git Bash on your computer, refer to the install guides provided on Canvas. In general, your workflow using GitHub Desktop will be as follows:

1. Open GitHub Desktop and select the repository you are working on
2. Run "Fetch origin" and "Pull origin" to synchronize your repository with the work saved on GitHub
3. Save your work after completing at least every Part in each lab document
4. Add a short commit message and run "Commit to master" 
5. Run "Push origin" to synchronize your local repository with GitHub for safekeeping.

When working on multiple computers you need to be careful not to make **merge conflicts**. Best practice is to commit and push the work regularly and **more importantly** before changing from one computer to another. This will ensure your remote repository on GitHub server is always up-to-date. 

*Good luck with your project!*
